Rix is an AI-first project assistant that turns a short project brief into ready-to-use development artifacts so teams can move from idea to execution faster. Enter a description for a software or hardware project and Rix generates a professional PRD, recommended technology stack, UI mockups, architecture diagrams, schematics/parts lists (for hardware), and step‑by‑step build guides. All results are saved to a lightweight dashboard where you can review, edit, and export Markdown, JSON, and images.

Why it matters

Helps non‑technical founders and makers produce developer-ready artifacts.
Speeds team alignment with consistent, editable outputs.
